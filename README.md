# BlueStaqCodeChallenge

I've decided to commit this as it currently is. 

For formmatting reasons it's generally best if the simulator is only has no more than 99 above ground floors and not more than 9 bassment floors.

This simulator is operating under several base assumtions.
1. The user needs to initiate any operations, think of this as the simulator only caring about the expirence of the operator.
2. This is not really using a proper elevator prioritization algorythm this was mostly done to save on time.
3. There elevator can only hold 10 passengers including the user and only up to 10 potential passengers can wait to be picked up at any time

Things that could be implemented in the future.
1. Add real time sim elements, with or without user input.
2. Multiple elevators
3. Actual elevator floor prioritization algorythm
4. Variable elevator capacity
5. Differing Passeneger behaviors, like choosing to take the stairs after a certain period of time
